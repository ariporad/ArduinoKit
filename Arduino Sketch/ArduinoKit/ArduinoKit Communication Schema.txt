ArduinoKit Communication Schema

To Initalize Connection:
Slave  (Arduino) : [On Loop] "ArduinoKit\n"
Master (Computer): "-\n"
Slave: "[id]\n" 
Slave: "-\n"
Now standard commands may be sent using syntax below. Always send a heartbeat at least once per second. After 3 missed heartbeats Slave will assume dissconnected. Slave will send heartbeat "0\n" at least once per second. After 3 missed heartbeats assume dissconnected.

To Close Connection:
Master: "-"

Connection is now closed. Slave assumes Dissconnected State.

Standard Command:
{A}[{B}{C}{D}[{E}]]\n

A: 0 = HeartBeat, must be sent once per second. Rest of line is blank.
   1 = Command, Must have B, C, D, E only if B = 1.
   2 = Pin Mode, Must have B, C, rest of line is blank.

B: For A = 1: 0 = Read, 1 = Write
   For A = 2: XX Pin Number, Int. Must be two digits.

C: For A = 1: 0 = Digital 1 = Analouge
   For A = 2: 0 = Output  1 = Input  2 = Input Pullup

D: XX Pin Number, Int. Must be two digits

E: Only Required if B = 1, Value to write. If C = 1, must be number between 0000 and 1023, otherwise 0000 for off/false, and 0001 for on/true, Int. Must be four digits.

The Slave may respond to, but may not send a standard command. A response will be an integer on it's own line.

All lines must end with a newline ("\n")

Any commands not understood will be ignored.
